    <h2>(a) What is Django and what is its main purpose?</h2>
    <p class="fs-5 ">Django is a Python-based web application framework <br> Django's main purpose is to simplify and speed up the development of web applications by providing a set of tools and abstractions that allow developers to focus on writing their application's logic instead of dealing with low-level details such as handling HTTP requests and responses, database integration, URL routing, security, and more.</p>
<br>
    <h2>(b) What is the difference between a view and a template in Django?</h2>
    <p class="fs-5"> View is responsible for processing the user's request and returning a response.<br> 
        While template is responsible for defining the structure and layout of the HTML output for that response. <br></p>
<br><br>
    <h2>(c) What is a model in Django and how is it used?</h2>
    <p class="fs-5">Model is a class that represents a database table and is used to define the data structure of the app.<br>
    We use models to design tables (data structures) to get, store and access data.</p>
